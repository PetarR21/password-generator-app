## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this challange.

Frist and foremost, I learned how to create custom range input, and custom checkboxes. I struggled a lot with these, and it was in a way a humbling experience, beacuse I saw how much more I have to learn.

I also learned how to use these custom inputs to generate a password based on selected options.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques for styling and layout, and to find a way to make the code more modular and reusable.

Also, I would like to improve my code in the future so it is more clean and simple.

### Useful resources

- [Change Color of SVG on Hover](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This helped me with styling SVGs.
- [Get started with Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - It is my first project, using Tailwind, so official docs were pretty helpful.
